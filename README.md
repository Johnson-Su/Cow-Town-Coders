# Farmily
A web platform where local growers and local buyers can connect to create farm to table solutions to address farm surplus.

## What is it?
Farmily is a web page designed to be easy to access and intuitive to use while still giving enough functionality to the user for its purpose to be achieved. Farmers are able to sign in on the app and put their location into a database which contains information on what they sell, their prices, how much they can sell, and also their farm name. The website will also allow for images to be posted for users to see what they are purchasing. For those looking to purchase food they are able to search around them for nearby farms where they are able to retrieve excess food that otherwise would have been thrown out. This simple design allows for consumers to directly interact with farmers and also serves to be a central hub for such interactions instead of the many small and scattered facebook groups that have a similar purpose.
